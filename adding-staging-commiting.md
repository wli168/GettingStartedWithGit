# Adding, Staging and Commiting

A git commit is analogous to saving a file after you have made edits. In git, however, it is more hands on then just clicking a save button. Think of a commit like taking a photograph of the current state of your work and then writing a note on the photo of what has changed compared to your previous photo.

Before you commit your work, git requires you to **add** or **stage** all the files that go into the commit into what it calls a **staging** area. This gives you more fine grained control at the file level to decide what goes into a commit. Going back to the photograph analogy, before actually taking the photo you decide and **add** all the items that will go into the photo into the **staging** area and then **commit** (click) the photo.

In this step you will create a commit that adds your name to the gitters.md file.

First modify the [gitters.md](gitter.md) file (Yulric, see comment). This is a markdown file. Add your name to the file by typing a hypen followed by your name in a new line. Look at line 3 in the gitters.md file for an example.

You'll code your programs (SAS, R, etc.) in your usual editor, not 

And you have sucessfully made your first ever commit!
